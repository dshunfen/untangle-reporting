# Beautiful Untangle NGFW Reporting

## Description
Untangle report email for Google Script based on backed-up content.
This came about as an alternative to the very generic and non-pretty
reports that are generated by Untangle.
Using Google scripts allows minimal intrusion on the firewall itself to gather data, is cloud based for high availability and is all in a nice looking easy-to-understand HTML format.

## Installation
1. Set up your Untangle Firewall to upload backup logs and configurations to a Google account
2. Create a Google script project (at `script.google.com`) that contains the two files in this repo.
3. Configure the following environment variables at the top of the `.gs` file, the key ones being:
  * `const NETWORK_NAME = '<Your network name>';`
  * `const REPORT_RECIPIENTS = "<Your list of email recipients>";`
4. Setup a scheduled job to run the `sendReport` function every 15 minutes
5. Enjoy your beautiful Untangle report! It contains an executive summary in the email body and 
an excel file with all of the important details to boot.
